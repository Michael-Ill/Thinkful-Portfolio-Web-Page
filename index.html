            <h3>About</h3>
        
        <section>
            <p>I grew up in small town Pennsylvania playing video games on any computer I could get my hands on. I've always been fascinated by technology
            in regards to computers. I've built many of my own PCs and decided it was finally time to learn the internal side of computers. I have a BS in Psychology
            from a small mercy college in PA, and since then I have been running my own frozen dessert business for the past 15 years. I look forward to learning from 
            others in the space as being a business owner has shown me that you need to rely on your teammates in order to achieve the most success. Web design has been 
            something I've been interested in since I first dabbled in HTML back in the late 90s, time to revisit and perfect it!</p>
